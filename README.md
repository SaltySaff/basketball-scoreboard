# Basketball Scoreboard

This is a simple basketball scoreboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to keep track of the score for two teams and reset the scores if necessary.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser. The CSS and JavaScript files are already included in the HTML file.

## Usage

* To use the scoreboard, click on the +1, +2, or +3 buttons for each team to add points to their score. The current score for each team is displayed in the center of their respective panel.

* To reset the score for a team, click on the "Reset" button at the bottom of their panel. This will set their score back to 0.

* The team names can be customized by changing the text in the `h3` elements with the class `team-name`.
